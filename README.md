## Figure 2

This figure shows the performance difference between PHACTboost, PHACT and MSAboost.

A. The performance of the PHACTboost algorithm was evaluated over the complete set of variations in the test set. B. Comparison of PHACTboost results over full test set, test set excluding same positions with the training set, and test set excluding the same proteins as training set. C. Feature Importance â€“ Shapley Values for PHACTboost algorithm. D. Comparison of PHACTboost with MSAboost which corresponds to the same machine learning algorithm with only MSA-based features over the whole dataset. E. Comparison of PHACTboost with MSAboost over the hard cases.

## Figure 3

A. ROC and PR curve comparisons of PHACTboost and other 40 tools reported in dbNSFP. B. ROC and PR curve comparisons of PHACTboost and other 39 tools reported in dbNSFP over hard cases. One tool is discarded since dbNSFP does not report sufficient number of variations. C. ROC and PR curve comparisons of PHACTboost and other 39 tools reported in dbNSFP over test set which includes different positions than training set. D. ROC and PR curve comparisons of PHACTboost and other 39 tools reported in dbNSFP over test set which includes different proteins than training set.

## Figure 4

A. AUROC and AUPR difference between PHACTboost and EVE, CPT-1, VARITY, gMVP and ENVISION over the whole test set. B. AUROC and AUPR difference between PHACTboost and EVE, CPT-1, VARITY, gMVP and ENVISION over hard cases. C. Protein-by-protein comparison of PHACTboost with EVE over 60 proteins with at least 3 neutral and 3 pathogenic variations. D. Comparison of average Spearman correlation between PHACTboost and DMS results with the average Spearman correlation between other tools and DMS data.
